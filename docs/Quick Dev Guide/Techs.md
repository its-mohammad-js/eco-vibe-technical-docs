# Technologies and Libraries Used

Like any other front-end project, this one also consists of a set of **core** libraries and **auxiliary** libraries, mostly used for developing and configuring the user interface (UI).

## Core Libraries: The Backbone of the Project

The core libraries that enable and facilitate UI configuration, development, backend interaction, and state management include:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Vite (6.0.2):</strong> A fast and modern build tool for optimizing the development process and enhancing performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>React (18.3.1) and React Router DOM (7.0.1):</strong> The foundation for building the UI, providing components and routing capabilities.
  </li>
