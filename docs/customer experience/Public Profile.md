### Profile Overview

Naturally, since there are two main types of users in the app, there are also two profiles. However, the profile related to personal information, defined as the customer profile, is responsible for updating user personal details. This profile is applicable to both sellers and customers. In fact, most of the information entered during the customer authentication process can be customized in this section. An important feature of this section is the ability to edit the profile picture, which is essential for both sellers and customers. This functionality is made accessible to users through a **[simple modal](https://github.com/its-mohammad-js/EcoVibe/blob/main/src/common/UI%20elements/ProfileImagePicker/ProfileImagePicker.jsx)**.

Another crucial section in the payment and purchase process is managing and adding credit cards, which updates one of the user's vital pieces of information. This is typically done through **[Add Credit card form](https://github.com/its-mohammad-js/EcoVibe/blob/main/src/common/UI%20elements/Forms/AddCreditCardForm.jsx)**, where the process of adding a credit card takes place and the user's information is updated.
