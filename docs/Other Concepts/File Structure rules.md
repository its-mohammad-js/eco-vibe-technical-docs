## Explaination

The approach for structuring the project's files is generally summarized in two main explanations. The first is a general overview and definition of each folder, which was **[previously](https://its-mohammad-js.github.io/eco-vibe-technical-docs/docs/Quick%20Dev%20Guide/File%20Structure%20Overview)** elaborated. In this section, the structure of the files related to the main `src` of the application is explained. In general, as it is clear, the main architecture of the application is defined in the **pages folder**, where the pages are divided in the same way as the routes are structured.

In the same way, the folder related to each component or page can consist of smaller components, custom hooks, and static values of the elements.

By **combining the strategy of route division based on user experience and the page-centric approach for components** and core elements of the application, efforts have been made to minimize unnecessary complexity, ensuring that the architecture and structure of the project are fully understandable and clear.
